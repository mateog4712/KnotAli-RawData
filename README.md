# KnotAli-RawData
Repository containing the data used within the program KnotAli and its tests.

Alignments were performed using the alignment softwares MUSCLE and MAFFT. The alignment of the post-shortened grp1 and srp was done using MAFFT and are thus found within the MAFFT alignments. The alignment of RF00177 was aligned within the RNAconTest_v1 paper and the alignment is obtained from the supplementary material. It is separate from the MUSCLE and MAFFT alignments.

For the experimental results, 16s and 23s are referred to as 16s2 and 23s2, respectively. This refers to the fact that only full sequence files were used instead of including domains
